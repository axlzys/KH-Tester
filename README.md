# KH-Tester
This open source project is an automatic KH test device (the automatic control KH code is not tested, use it with caution)
The principle of this equipment is the hydrochloric acid titration method. Due to the selected peristaltic pump flow rate, dripper, reaction chamber volume and other reasons, the test accuracy is 0.1dkh, which basically meets the daily monitoring needs of sea tanks.
The hydrochloric acid used for detection was 0.1N (0.1mol/L) standard solution. After testing, the detected wastewater can be directly discharged into the tank.
