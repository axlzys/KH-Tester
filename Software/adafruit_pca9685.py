`adafruit_pca9685`
====================================================

Driver for the PCA9685 PWM control IC. Its commonly used to control servos, leds and motors.

.. seealso:: The `Adafruit CircuitPython Motor library
    <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Motor>`_ can be used to control the PWM
    outputs for specific uses instead of generic duty_cycle adjustments.

* Author(s): Scott Shawcroft
